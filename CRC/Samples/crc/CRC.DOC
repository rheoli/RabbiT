		Cyclic Redundancy Check
---------------------------------------------------------

This archive includes the following three files:

	crc2.c		Computes crc by bit shifting
	crcfast.c	Computes crc by table lookup
	crctab.c	Computes tables used in crcfast.c
	crc.doc		This file

	The utilities crc2 and crcfast compute the cyclic redundancy checks
for both the crc-16 (used in arc files) and crc-ccitt (used in xmodem).
crcfast is faster than crc2.  These routines compute the crc's for a
given file as a means of checking data integrity.
	These routines compile without change under Turbo C.  All are
short and illustrate the basic principles of crc calculations.
